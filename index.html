      I acomplished designing a robot that could shoot balls into a hole and a robot that can pick up a cup of water and pour it in a vessel 2 meters away this week. I am looking to learning new things this week. Someting I liked about this week was that I hung out with friends. I also starting working out again.

          October 1, 2021 I accomplished in making a succecful Rube Goldberg machine. At first I was having a couple problems withmaking the machine but with the help of Mr. Poole, I got it done. Im looking forward to accomplish the next project the same way I did with this. I also had a lot of fun making the machine and listening to music with our class at the same time. Another thing I did this week was the Wednsday challenge. Even though I messed it up, I stilled learned my mistake and I am much more confident that I can do it better. I learned that the saw is about an inch thick which takesoff about an inchfrom your measurment on the wood.
